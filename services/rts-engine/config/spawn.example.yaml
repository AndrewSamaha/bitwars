# Set SPAWN_CONFIG_PATH to this file. No player entities spawn at match start;
# when a player joins (first stream connect), the engine assigns one spawn point
# and one loadout chosen at random from the loadouts list.
#
# game_origin: [x, y] center of world (default [0, 0]); used for procedural spawn if spawn_points is empty.
# max_distance_from_origin: max distance for procedural spawn (default 10000).
# spawn_points: list of [x, y]; one is assigned per joining player in order. If empty, positions are random within max_distance_from_origin.
# loadouts: list of loadout options; each player gets one chosen at random.
# neutrals_near_spawn: optional server-owned entities near each player's spawn.
