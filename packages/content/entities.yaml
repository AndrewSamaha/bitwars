# Entity type definitions — M4: Data-Driven Entities
#
# This file is the source of truth for entity properties. The engine loads it
# at startup and computes a deterministic content hash (canonicalized JSON,
# xxh3-64) for version pinning.
#
# Rules:
# - entity_type_id is the YAML key (e.g. "worker"). Never recycle IDs.
# - All numeric values are floats. Add new fields with serde defaults so
#   existing definitions don't break.
