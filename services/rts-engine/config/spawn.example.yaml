# when a player joins (first stream connect), the engine picks a procedural
# spawn location and one loadout chosen at random from the loadouts list.

# game_origin: [x, y] center of world (default [0, 0]); used for procedural player spawn.
# max_distance_from_origin: max distance for procedural player spawn (default 10000).
# min_entity_spawn_distance / max_entity_spawn_distance: controls spacing between newly spawned player-owned units.
# loadouts: list of loadout options; each player gets one chosen at random.
# neutrals_near_spawn: optional server-owned entities near each player's spawn.
